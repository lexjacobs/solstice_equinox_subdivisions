# Solstice Equinox Subdivisions
Subdividing the periods between the solstices and equinoxes.

Exact millisecond calculations of solstice/equinox periods by dividing the known quarters
obtained via a combination of the [frink packages](https://frinklang.org/): `secant` and `exactSeasons`.

Subdivisions calculated between known quantities. For example, `Spring 2015` is obtained directly from the frink calculation. Further subdivisions are derived by by dividing the known quarters of the year into approximately derived sections.
